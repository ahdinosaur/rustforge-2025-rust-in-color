## 3 Sentence Description

Rust + LEDs = ðŸ’œ. Rust empowers us to think at a high-level for low-level systems. Join me in how I made an LED cube with embedded Rust (no-std & no-alloc), and how you could too.

## Description

Rust + LEDs = ðŸ’œ

Rust empowers us to think at a high-level for low-level systems.

Join me in how I made an LED cube with embedded Rust (no-std & no-alloc):

- Define LED layouts as geometric shapes like lines, grids, etc
- Write patterns like graphics shaders: compute colors for each LED based on position and other data
- Drive any any LED chipset, use traits as powerful abstractions
- All without any standard library or heap allocations

What would you make with LEDs and Rust?
