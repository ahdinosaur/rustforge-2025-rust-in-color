## 3 Sentence Description

LEDs + Rust = ðŸ’œ. Join me in how I made an LED cube with embedded Rust. What would you make with LEDs and Rust?

## Description

LEDs + Rust = ðŸ’œ

Join me in how I made an LED cube with embedded (no-std & no-alloc) Rust.

Rust empowers us to think at a high-level for low-level systems:

- Define LED layouts as geometric shapes like lines, grids, etc
- Write patterns like graphics shaders: compute colors for each LED based on position and other data
- Drive any any LED chipset, use traits as powerful abstractions
- All without any standard library or heap allocations

What do you want to make with LEDs and Rust?
